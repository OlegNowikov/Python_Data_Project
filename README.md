### Visualize Data
```Python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)
for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title_short']==job_title].head(5)
    df_plot.plot(kind='barh',x='job_skills', y='skill_count', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
    ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
fig.suptitle('Counts of Top Skills in Job Postings', fontsize = 14)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5)
plt.show()
```
